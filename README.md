### Problems and Solutions

**Problem**: When initially scraping sets of data, some values dont exist. For example: Some companies dont have a glassdoor estimate salary, this is bringing up errors.
**Solution**: Used a few Try Except blocks and fixed the issue.

**Problem**: Cannot seem to get consistent pages when I run the script. Glassdoor seems to give different results every time I reload the page.
**Solution** No solution currently.
